# Documentation

Delphi is a versatile and adaptable conversational agent framework that
streamlines chatbots and AI-driven agent systems. Its design prioritizes
abstraction and provider-independence, allowing for seamless integration with
various message providers. Delphi is compatible with a range of environments,
including browsers, Node.js, and Deno, making it an ideal choice for diverse
application scenarios.
